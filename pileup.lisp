  "A thread-safe binary heap.

Heap operations which need the heap to remain consistent heap lock it. Users
can also group multiple heap operations into atomic units using
WITH-LOCKED-HEAP.

Thread-safety is implemented using a single lock per heap. While Pileup heaps
are fine for threaded use, a more specialized solution is recommended when the
heap is highly contested between multiple threads.

Important: Pileup heaps are not asynch-unwind safe: asynchronous interrupts
causing non-local exits may leave the heap in an inconsistent state or lose
data. Do not use INTERRUPT-THREAD or asychronous timeouts with Pileup.

All slot names in HEAP are internal to the PILEUP package, so it is safe to
subclass using eg. DEFSTRUCT :INCLUDE, as long as only the exported operations
are used to accessor or modify heap state."

The PREDICATE determines the ordering of the heap. It must be a function of two

exit from a heap operation, it may leave the heap in an inconsistent state and
cause a subsequent heap operation to signal an error.

If KEY is not NIL, it must be a function of one argument, and is used to
extract values for use by PREDICATE for comparison.

The NAME can be used to optionally specify a name for the heap: it affects only
printing of the heap.

The SIZE is the size of the storage initially reserved for the heap.

an error to be signalled.
